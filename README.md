# RL-CartPole-Keras-rl2
Reinforcement Learning with open AI gym and Keras-rl2
This RL model uses OpenAI gym to create environment and specifically uses 'CartPole-v0' which is a pen balancing program based on physics simulation.

To use:
Use reload-from-mem to use learned weights and avoid training to test the model

To see the training:
Open (train-test) file and install all dependencies 
run the program and change visualize=False to True to visualise training process
